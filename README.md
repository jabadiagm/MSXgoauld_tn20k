MSX2+ engine in Z80 socket. It turns one MSX into an MSX2+ by replacing Z80 processor. FPGA in board contains: 
* Z80
* V9958 with hdmi output
* MSX2+ BIOS
* 4MB mapper
* RTC
* PSG through hdmi
* OPLL through hdmi
* SCC (audio only) through hdmi

## How it works
Logic acts on bus control signals so that internal devices inside fpga take priority over external devices.

## Boards

There are two lines of boards, 1.4 (by Palver, DIP & SMD) and 4.1 (by Chandler, SMD). Main difference is the orientation of the hdmi connector, to the same side of Z80's pin 1 (4.1) or the opposite (1.4). Revisions 2, 3, 4 are outdated and kept for reference only. 

Mind Revision 4.1 uses 74LVC245 in U5. Although their technical information tells they require 3.3V to operate, they are also 5V tolerant. This has been tested and considered safe. Check https://github.com/jabadiagm/MSXgoauld_tn20k/issues/15 for more information.

## Slot map

![Slot map](/pics/mapa_slots3.png)

Mapper can be relocated to slots 1, 2, or 3 using config menu.

## Update from previous hardware (V1, V2, V3, V4)
* Replace U1, U2 -> 74HC373, U5 -> 74HC245
* Solder a 10K resistor array to data bus lines, pulled up to 5V

## SCC audio
SCC is located in Slot 0-2 to use with sofarun, using these settings:

## Configuration
Config menu is showed pressing g during MSX logo. New improved menu is created by [nataliapc](https://github.com/nataliapc/msx_goauld_settings_menu)

![Config](/pics/config4.png)

* Enable Mapper: On by default. Disable when having compatibility issues or to use a different mapper
* Mapper Slot: 0 by default. Change to 1-3 to get mapper in a not expanded slot (best compatibility). Physical slot will be disabled
* Slot 1 Ghost SCC: Off by default. Enable to get sound from an SCC cartridge located in slot 1
* Enable Scanlines: On by default. Disable to get a clean hdmi picture
* Save & Exit: store new config and continue, changes in mapper settings will be effective after pressing reset
* Save & Reset: store new config and make software reset, changes will be immediate

## Slots dance
Goa'uld has four internal slots available. As with other modules, internal slots take priority over physical ones. This means that when a device is using internal slot n, then physical slot n is disabled  and any cartridge in that slot will not be detected. 
By default, BIOS and mapper occupy internal slot 0, leaving physical slots 1 to 3 available for cartridges. However, this default layout can cause compatibility issues with some software, such as tape games. 
To resolve these issues, you can move the mapper from expanded slot 0 to one of the non-expanded internal slots (1, 2, or 3). This adjustment can solve many compatibility problems.

## Known issues
* Reset from config menu is not compatible with some hardware. Use physical reset button when possible
* Multimente: shows garbage characters. Move internal mapper to slots 1, 2 or 3
* Tape games fail: move internal mapper to slots 1, 2 or 3
* Noises when loading a rom with sofarun: change sofarun settings to use mapper for that rom
* Carnivore C2 software reset is not compatible with goa'uld

## HDMI wiring
Use a flat cable with detachable connectors, like [this](https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ex8dto0) or [this](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oEFYFU9)

### Tips
* Try a proven board first to check if your msx is compatible
* Get integrated circuits from trusted sources
* Use a heatsink when possible
* Use turned pins in header to avoid damages in Z80 socket
![turned header](/pics/torneados.jpg)
* Board is sensitive to dirty electrical contacts, way more than Z80. Keep cartridge & Z80 socket contacts clean
* When soldering headers, start with the inner one (Z80)
